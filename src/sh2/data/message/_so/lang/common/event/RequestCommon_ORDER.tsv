ER01_ORDER	The client's a detective. We'll find him in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''>, so let's go talk to him.
ER02_ORDER	We got another request from the detective, Masayoshi. This time, though, Madam Ginko made it sound a little ominous... I should go to <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''> and see what's up.
ER35_ORDER	It's the detective <tags=''13''g=''1''>Masayoshi<tage=''13''g=''1''> again. Let's drop by <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''> and see what he wants this time.
ER03_ORDER	Another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Masayoshi<tage=''13''g=''1''>. This time, though, it's for ''something only I can help with''... Wonder what's going on.
ER04_ORDER	<tags=''13''g=''1''>Flamma<tage=''13''g=''1''>'s called me to the Axis for a specific assignment. For context, Aion's constantly scanning the internet to collect data from devices all over the world. Except over the past month, the devices Aion's been accessing are getting destroyed. So Flamma wants me to investigate one of those cases. Not every day Flamma directly asks for my help, so I'll see what I can do for her. The plan is to pick up a broken <tags=''13''g=''1''>COMP<tage=''13''g=''1''> that belonged to this Summoner guy <tags=''13''g=''1''>Akira<tage=''13''g=''1''>. He's apparently a regular at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Heidrun<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER05_ORDER	<tags=''13''g=''1''>Flamma<tage=''13''g=''1''> needs our help. Apparently, while investigating the case of <tags=''13''g=''1''>devices being destroyed<tage=''13''g=''1''>, she received a message saying her interference would be â€œpunished.'' The message came from a standard smartphone, owned by a <tags=''13''g=''1''>host<tage=''13''g=''1''> named <tags=''13''g=''1''>Teruya<tage=''13''g=''1''>... If I remember right, that's the same guy outside Cretaceous who got shot down by the Summoner, Chris. Sounds like a good time to check up on him. 
ER06_ORDER	Flamma's got an update. Apparently she's identified the demon trying to obstruct Aion's data collection: <tags=''13''g=''1''>Pazuzu<tage=''13''g=''1''>, an ancient wind demon with a real nasty edge to him. Sounds like he's in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Tower C of the Ozaki Hope Towers<tage=''13''g=''1''>... Gotta say, I've got a bad feeling about this. We'd better take him down, and fast.
ER07_ORDER	This one's from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Yume<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the checkout girl at <tags=''13''g=''1''>De La Mancha<tage=''13''g=''1''> in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Karakucho<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Let's go see what's up.
ER08_ORDER	Got another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Yume<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the girl from <tags=''13''g=''1''>De La Mancha<tage=''13''g=''1''>. From what Madam Ginko says, Yume's got a pretty substantial spiritual presence even as a normal person, but that's what keeps drawing all these demonic messes her way. I'd better help her out.
ER09_ORDER	We've got another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Yume<tage=''13''g=''1''>. It sounds like something's going on with her brother... I'd better head to <tags=''13''g=''1''>De La Mancha<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER10_ORDER	This is a request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mannequin<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the guy working at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Zafiro<tage=''13''g=''1''> in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Sounds like we need to help out before he gets in over his head... Let's go check it out.
ER11_ORDER	Another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mannequin<tage=''13''g=''1''>. He's got us <tags=''13''g=''1''>looking for another rare find<tage=''13''g=''1''>, and it sounds like this one ended up with a Summoner too. Might as well finish what I started...
ER12_ORDER	This'll be the third request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mannequin<tage=''13''g=''1''>, which means it's time to hunt down the last accessory. <tags=''3''g=''1'' id=''Key_028''>, I think. Let's head to <tags=''13''g=''1''>Zafiro<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER13_ORDER	We've got a job from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Lina<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the proprietress of <tags=''13''g=''1''>Yang Yang Palace<tage=''13''g=''1''> over in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mansei Realm<tage=''13''g=''1''>. According to Madam Ginko, Lina's pretty picky about her business associates... but I'm sure it'll be fine.
ER14_ORDER	Another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Lina<tage=''13''g=''1''>, huh? Looks like we'll be helping her out with <tags=''13''g=''1''>work<tage=''13''g=''1''> again. If it's another handoff like last time, this'll be a breeze.
ER15_ORDER	I got another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Lina<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Madam Ginko says her approach to her work comes from experience and conviction as a merchant, but I don't know if it counts as ''conviction'' if she'll do anything for money...
ER16_ORDER	We've got a job from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Tara<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the owner of <tags=''13''g=''1''>COMP Smith<tage=''13''g=''1''> over in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mansei Realm<tage=''13''g=''1''>. She needs some help with her work, but I have no idea what she expects me to do about it. Am I gonna learn how to upgrade COMPs?
ER17_ORDER	Another job from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Tara<tage=''13''g=''1''>. I'd better go drop by <tags=''13''g=''1''>COMP Smith<tage=''13''g=''1''> in Mansei Realm.
ER18_ORDER	Got another job from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Tara<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Seems like she's still struggling, though... Let's go hear what's on her mind.
ER19_ORDER	This request is from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Victor<tage=''13''g=''1''>, master of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Cirque du Goumaden<tage=''13''g=''1''> in Roppo Realm. He's loud, eccentric, and hard to talk to, but Madam Ginko seems to think pretty highly of him. I'll be helping with his experiments, but... what exactly will that entail?
ER20_ORDER	Got another job from the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Cirque du Goumaden<tage=''13''g=''1''>'s weird old ringmaster. I guess Victor's taken a shine to me... not that I mind, since I always like learning more about his work.
ER21_ORDER	Another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Victor<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Cirque du Goumaden<tage=''13''g=''1''>'s resident ringmaster. That means I'm bound for Roppo Realm.
ER22_ORDER	Another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Victor<tage=''13''g=''1''>. I'd better head to the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Cirque du Goumaden<tage=''13''g=''1''> in Roppo Realm.
ER23_ORDER	According to Madam Ginko, the client here's looking for <tags=''13''g=''1''>someone I know well<tage=''13''g=''1''>. That definitely narrows it down... Wonder who it is. I'd better head to <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER24_ORDER	This request comes from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Ash<tage=''13''g=''1''>. And it sounds like it has something to do with Saizo. I wonder what's going on...? Well, I'll find Ash in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Roppo Realm<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER25_ORDER	This is a request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Ichika<tage=''13''g=''1''>... as in, the girl at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Komadori<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Wonder if something's happened... I should go talk to her.
ER26_ORDER	I met <tags=''13''g=''1''>Frost Ichiro<tage=''13''g=''1''> the Jack Frost near the entrance of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>East Shipping District<tage=''13''g=''1''>. He's the eldest of the Jack Frost brothers, and he wants a home where his family can live peacefully. But the area's full of <tags=''8''g=''1'' id=''NKNR_118''>s, and his brother Frost Jiro's allergic to spiders... so he wants me to beat <tags=''17''g=''1''>5<tage=''17''g=''1''> <tags=''8''g=''1'' id=''NKNR_118''>s for his brother. I guess even demons can have allergies?
ER27_ORDER	I met <tags=''13''g=''1''>Frost Jiro<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the polite Jack Frost, at the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Middle Area<tage=''13''g=''1''> of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Central Line<tage=''13''g=''1''>. He's the second oldest of the Jack Frost brothers, and he wants a home where they can live quietly. But this place is full of <tags=''8''g=''1'' id=''NKNR_092''>s, and the third-oldest brother, Frost Saburo, is allergic to pigs. So now he wants me to beat <tags=''17''g=''1''>5<tage=''17''g=''1''> <tags=''8''g=''1'' id=''NKNR_092''>s for his brother's sake.
ER28_ORDER	I met another Jack Frost in the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Upper Area<tage=''13''g=''1''> of Subway Line 14: <tags=''13''g=''1''>Frost Saburo<tage=''13''g=''1''>, a Frost with a strange way of talking. He told me he's been out making money somewhere far away... I guess that explains why he sounds like that. Anyway, the point is he wants me to take out <tags=''13''g=''1''>5<tage=''13''g=''1''> <tags=''8''g=''1'' id=''NKNR_101''>s, 'cause his little brother's allergic to them. Let's hee-go.
ER29_ORDER	I met the... ''well-traveled'' Jack Frost <tags=''13''g=''1''>Frost Shiro<tage=''13''g=''1''> at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Ozaki Hope Towers<tage=''13''g=''1''>. He claims he's a genius, and he peppers all his speech with foreign words, but I don't know if that's how polyglots actually talk. Anyhow, he wants me to beat <tags=''17''g=''1''>5<tage=''17''g=''1''> <tags=''8''g=''1'' id=''NKNR_106''> because his brother's allergic to... two-legged horses...? Look, I don't know, man. It's a big world. That could be a real allergy.
ER30_ORDER	I met Frost Goro, fifth of the Frost Brothers, at the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Municipal Tower<tage=''13''g=''1''>. The way he was talking kind of freaked me out at first, but it sounds like he wants me to beat <tags=''17''g=''1''>5<tage=''17''g=''1''> <tags=''8''g=''1'' id=''NKNR_041''>s because his dad's allergic to white tigers. Also, the reason he talks so weird is apparently because... he was abducted by aliens. So, you know. I guess this is my life now.
ER31_ORDER	I met a crying <tags=''13''g=''1''>Makami<tage=''13''g=''1''> in the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Middle Area<tage=''13''g=''1''> of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Central Line<tage=''13''g=''1''>. He told me a <tags=''13''g=''1''>demon with a scary face<tage=''13''g=''1''> came to the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Upper Area<tage=''13''g=''1''> and kicked him out of his home... I know it's a dog-eat-dog world, especially for demons, but making a kid cry is pretty rotten. I'm gonna go teach him a lesson.
ER32_ORDER	I bumped into that <tags=''13''g=''1''>Makami<tage=''13''g=''1''> from the <tags=''13''g=''1''>West Shipping District<tage=''13''g=''1''> again. Sounds like all that lying got him in trouble with a really <tags=''13''g=''1''>vicious demon<tage=''13''g=''1''>, and now they're out for blood. It's his own fault, and he kind of had it coming... but I'd feel bad ignoring a cry for help, even if it is from him. I guess I'll help one last time, for the sake of this ''brother'' of his. The enemy demon's at the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Central Line<tage=''13''g=''1''>, in the room where I fought the other target before.
ER33_ORDER	The client's another Summoner this time. Sounds like we're going after a <tags=''13''g=''1''>criminal Summoner<tage=''13''g=''1''> who's been abusing their powers... The client's waiting at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER34_ORDER	Got another job from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Saki<tage=''13''g=''1''>, the bounty hunter Summoner. Let's head to <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER36_ORDER	This job's gonna have us helping a veteran Summoner. It sounds like he needs help <tags=''13''g=''1''>tracking something down<tage=''13''g=''1''>... The client's over in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mansei Realm<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER37_ORDER	Another request from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Saki<tage=''13''g=''1''>. If this is anything like her other jobs, there's gonna be a fight involved. I'd better stock up and head to <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''>. 
ER38_ORDER	The client's a guy working at a host club in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Karakucho<tage=''13''g=''1''>. He needs our help <tags=''13''g=''1''>finding someone<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER39_ORDER	The client this time is a lady who works at a cabaret club in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Karakucho<tage=''13''g=''1''>. She's looking for her <tags=''13''g=''1''>older brother<tage=''13''g=''1''>, who's gone missing.
ER40_ORDER	I met a <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mermaid<tage=''13''g=''1''> demon in the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Ozaki Hope Towers<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Her old master, <tags=''13''g=''1''>Hans<tage=''13''g=''1''>, quit being a Summoner, and now she's looking for him so she can chew him out. Let's see, Hans... Can't say the name rings a bell. Apparently he said he was going to work in a <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''> store called <tags=''13''g=''1''>Undine<tage=''13''g=''1''>...
ER41_ORDER	Madam Ginko says a letter for me arrived at Club Cretaceous. Thing is... it's addressed from <tags=''13''g=''1''>R.S.<tage=''13''g=''1''> In other words, the Summoner Arrow and I beat back when we first met. Somehow I doubt he could've come back to life, but... I should probably go investigate at the <tags=''13''g=''1''>West Shipping District<tage=''13''g=''1''> anyway.
ER42_ORDER	Our client this time is one of the people living in the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Central Line<tage=''13''g=''1''>. They'll be somewhere in the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Middle Area<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER43_ORDER	Madam Ginko says the client's father is about to commit suicide. No time to waste. The client's in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Karakucho<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER44_ORDER	This request is from someone on the <tags=''13''g=''1''>24th Ward Municipal Tower<tage=''13''g=''1''>'s staff. Sounds like we're seeing repercussions from Figue's choice already... I'm her partner, so I need to handle this.
ER45_ORDER	It sounds like this job requires a lot of <tags=''13''g=''1''>knowledge<tage=''13''g=''1''> about demons... I guess it's technically perfect for me, since Aion's all about gathering information. Let's go meet up with the guy in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Roppo Realm<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER46_ORDER	It's another request from the guy who hired me for the quiz box. But didn't we already figure out the answers? Maybe he ran into complications... I should go find him in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Roppo Realm<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER47_ORDER	Another job from that Summoner <tags=''13''g=''1''>Kyuta<tage=''13''g=''1''>. If he needs help with another quiz, I take it he hasn't tracked down that inheritance yet.
ER48_ORDER	This time, our client is <tags=''13''g=''1''>Madam Ginko<tage=''13''g=''1''> herself. She says there's a serious <tags=''13''g=''1''>threat<tage=''13''g=''1''> approaching... and preparing for this threat is the entire reason she runs Cretaceous in the first place. For now, I've gotta head to the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Lower Area<tage=''13''g=''1''> of <tags=''13''g=''1''>Subway Line 14<tage=''13''g=''1''> and check for anything suspicious.
ER49_ORDER	It sounds like the <tags=''13''g=''1''>coming threat<tage=''13''g=''1''> is bringing all kinds of deadly demons out of the woodwork. Now, I've got to put one of them down. My job's to hunt down the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Dakini<tage=''13''g=''1''> in the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Ozaki Hope Towers<tage=''13''g=''1''>. She'll be on the <tags=''13''g=''1''>3rd floor<tage=''13''g=''1''> of <tags=''13''g=''1''>Tower B<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER50_ORDER	The <tags=''13''g=''1''>threat<tage=''13''g=''1''> has arrived. Demons are launching attacks all across the city, but if I can take down the one driving them all forward, I can end this for good. Their leader's at the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Municipal Tower<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Let's end this before our defenses break down.
ER51_ORDER	I met someone in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Karakucho<tage=''13''g=''1''> who seemed troubled, so I referred him to Madam Ginko. Now he's got a request up. According to her, he used to be a famous actor... I've picked up some basic idea of movies, but I haven't seen any myself. Apparently this actor's the grandson of the star of the classic <tags=''13''g=''1''>Eliza<tage=''13''g=''1''>. But wait a sec... Maybe I should get to <tags=''13''g=''1''>Karakucho<tage=''13''g=''1''> and talk to the client myself.
ER52_ORDER	I met a <tags=''13''g=''1''>strange girl<tage=''13''g=''1''> in <tags=''13''g=''1''>Roppo Realm<tage=''13''g=''1''>. She wasn't doing too well... She said she was hungry, but she wanted <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mistiques<tage=''13''g=''1''>. As in, the Mistiques you get from loyal demons and attach to your COMP. Something's not adding up here, but... the girl seems harmless, so if I've got any spare Mistiques, I guess I could hand one over.
ER91_ORDER	There's been an incident where a student was attacked by a ''<tags=''13''g=''1''>monster<tage=''13''g=''1''>.'' We should go to <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shinsando<tage=''13''g=''1''> and ask the client for some details.
ER92_ORDER	After the incident in Shinsando, there've been a ton of similar <tags=''13''g=''1''>assaults<tage=''13''g=''1''> all over the city. Cretaceous is being flooded with requests to investigate the incidents, and it looks like I'm in charge of checking out the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Shipping District<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Let's get to it.
ER93_ORDER	This time, the client was <tags=''13''g=''1''>Nana<tage=''13''g=''1''> herself. Her dad's death hit her hard, but she wants to learn more about him. That way, she can learn more about herself... She's a tough kid. Apparently, Mangetsu and Gen Mayumi were working on the same research. We might find something back at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Mangetsu's hideout<tage=''13''g=''1''> in the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Central Line<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Let's take Nana to the hideout.
ER94_ORDER	<tags=''13''g=''1''>Nana<tage=''13''g=''1''>'s asked for our help with another job. Sounds like we'll need to go beat a demon in Subway Line 14 with her, but... I think we'd better get some more details from her at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Cirque du Goumaden<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
ER95_ORDER	This'll be our third job from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Nana<tage=''13''g=''1''>. We got permission to check out Gen Mayumi's research facility. Whatever's making these <tags=''13''g=''1''>Lost Numbers<tage=''13''g=''1''> appear is bound to be at the <tags=''13''g=''1''>research facility in Hachigaya<tage=''13''g=''1''>, along with the truth Nana's looking for... whatever that ends up being.
ER96_ORDER	This request comes direct from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Madam Ginko<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Our job's to eliminate a ''harmful'' Lost Number... but Nana's not necessarily a threat. We need to prove that she's not ''harmful''â€”not just to Yatagarasu, but to herself. Nana should be waiting for us at <tags=''13''g=''1''>Hachigaya Training Field<tage=''13''g=''1''>, where we were before.
ER97_ORDER	This one's a request from Arrow. He deciphered the <tags=''3''g=''1'' id=''Key_040''>, and he wants it delivered to Nana. As to <tags=''13''g=''1''>where she'd be<tage=''13''g=''1''>... One place comes to mind. Maybe I can get us a table.
ER81_ORDER	I got a request from the Yatagarasu Summoner on <tags=''13''g=''1''>B11F<tage=''13''g=''1''> of <tags=''13''g=''1''>Hachigaya Training Field<tage=''13''g=''1''>. There's a powerful <tags=''13''g=''1''>demon<tage=''13''g=''1''> on the <tags=''13''g=''1''>highest floor<tage=''13''g=''1''> of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Seido<tage=''13''g=''1''>, and it's keeping him from investigating the area. This place is a training ground for Yatagarasu agents... Sticking around here might get me some useful experience and some cool finds. This could work out for both of us.
ER82_ORDER	I got a request from the Yatagarasu Summoner on <tags=''13''g=''1''>B15F<tage=''13''g=''1''> of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Hachigaya Training Field<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Yatagarasu's investigating further, and they found another <tags=''13''g=''1''>powerful demon<tage=''13''g=''1''> on the <tags=''13''g=''1''>top floor<tage=''13''g=''1''> of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Hokudo<tage=''13''g=''1''>. All these Yatagarasu folks asking for my help... Maybe I'm getting a little famous around here. Maybe a little too famous. Ah, but whatever... It's fine as long as they don't make trouble for us. Anyhow, time to go search the Nando.
ER83_ORDER	A job direct from <tags=''13''g=''1''>Yatagarasu<tage=''13''g=''1''>. Probably another one at the <tags=''13''g=''1''>Hachigaya Training Field<tage=''13''g=''1''>. They're asking for me specifically, so it seems like a chance to get into their good books. The client's at the entrance of the <tags=''13''g=''1''>training field<tage=''13''g=''1''>.
